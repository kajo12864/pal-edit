<h2>Pal-Edit - Simple Technical Palette Editor</h2>
<p>I created pal-edit to be able to automatically recolor an entire sheet of sprites given what color I would like to change and the replacement color. I originally created this project in Python, then remade it in Qt as my first practical GUI project.</p>

<h3>Useage</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Open a valid .png, .jpg, or .bmp file (File -> Open).</li>
  <li>Use an external art program to colorpick and find the RGB values of the color you would like to replace (ex. 255 0 0 is pure red).</li>
  <li>Input the R, G, and B values into the program separately.</li>
  <li>Find the RGB values of the color you would like to use as a replacement.</li>
  <li>Input these values in their respective slots.</li>
  <li>Press apply.</li>
  <li>Go to File -> Save As and save the modified image.</li>
</ol>
